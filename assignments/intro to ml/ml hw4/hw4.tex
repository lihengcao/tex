\section{}
When $ w_0 $ increases, then the probability of predicting class 1 becomes higher, and vice versa. 
\[ h(x) = \dfrac{1}{1+e^{-(w_0 + \cdots)}} \]
This is because as $ w_0 $ gets bigger, the result of exponentiation gets smaller. As the denominator gets smaller, the quotient gets larger. $ h(x) $ is used as the probability we will predict a certain class. The higher $ h(x) $ is, the more likely we will predict class 1 (as opposed to class 0).

The logistic function is \[ \dfrac{1}{1+e^{-\textbf{w}^T \textbf{x}}} \]
If we were to double $ \textbf{w} $, the result wouldn't actually change, as long as the threshold is 0.5. 

The geometric interpretation is because $ \textbf{w}^T\textbf{x} $ represents a (hyper)plane. Multiplying the equation of a plane doesn't affect any points that are on the plane (threshold = 0.5 $\implies$ on hyperplane), but it makes the points that are off it seem further away, increasing the certainty with which we pick a class. For example, if $ \textbf{w}^T\textbf{x} = 0$, then there is no change ($ 0 * 2 = 0 $). But if it's positive, it becomes a larger positive number, and vice versa.
